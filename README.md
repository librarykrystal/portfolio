# Hello!

I'm Krystal Frost.  This project is my personal website to showcase software engineering projects.

The deployed site can be visited [here!](https://www.krystalfrost.com/)

## Prerequisites

This app was built with Node, React, and Material UI (and a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Install Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

The first section of the homepage details my professional skills, values, and work style.

The second section on /home visually showcases some of my (other) favorite projects. The buttons can be clicked to go to the respective GitHub repos.

On the left side of the nav bar, there are white internal navigation icons for /home and /about. Click the second to go to /about where you will find a short bio and a fun bonus: the "Random Thing I Like Generator"! Click the button on the generator to see a randomly generated thing I like. Do this as many times as YOU like.

On the right side of the nav bar, black icons link to external locations: my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub profile, and a paintbrush icon linking to this project's sister site, which features my artwork. The repo for that site can be found [here](https://github.com/librarykrystal/art-portfolio) and the deployed site visited [here](https://www.galleryoffrost.com/).
